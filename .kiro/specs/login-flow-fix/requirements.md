# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has a UI bug where after successful login, both the authentication page and the main application interface are displayed simultaneously. Users should see a clean transition from the login screen to the main application without any overlapping content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the login screen to completely disappear after successful authentication, so that I only see the main application interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the authentication page SHALL be completely hidden
2. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the main application interface SHALL be displayed without any authentication elements visible
3. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the authentication page SHALL be completely hidden
4. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the main application interface SHALL be displayed without any authentication elements visible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth visual transition between login and main app, so that the interface feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the page transition SHALL occur without visual glitches
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN there SHALL be no overlapping content between auth and main app
3. WHEN the main app is shown THEN all authentication forms SHALL be completely removed from view

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to properly handle the display state during authentication, so that I don't see confusing interface elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes with a valid token THEN only the main app interface SHALL be visible
2. WHEN the app initializes without a valid token THEN only the authentication page SHALL be visible
3. WHEN token verification fails THEN the app SHALL show only the authentication page
4. WHEN logout occurs THEN the app SHALL show only the authentication page and hide all main app elements
