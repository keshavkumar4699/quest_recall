# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix the showMainApp method to properly hide authentication page

  - Modify the `showMainApp()` method in `public/app.js` to call `hideAllPages()` before showing main app elements
  - Ensure the home page is properly activated after hiding all pages
  - Maintain the existing functionality of showing header, stats dashboard, and updating user display
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Add CSS rules to ensure proper page visibility control

  - Verify that the CSS has proper rules for `.page` and `.page.active` classes
  - Add any missing CSS rules to ensure pages are hidden by default and only shown when active
  - Ensure smooth transitions between page states
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 3.1_

- [x] 3. Test the authentication flow transitions

  - Create test cases to verify login flow properly hides auth page and shows main app
  - Create test cases to verify registration flow properly hides auth page and shows main app
  - Create test cases to verify logout flow properly hides main app and shows auth page
  - Verify app initialization with valid/invalid tokens shows correct pages
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
